## Aging and Memory

As we age, our memory is not what it was. In healthy individuals the signs are annoying but in dementia they are disastrous. Sadly the suggestion is that if we lived long enough we would all progress to dementia in the end.

One early complaint that people make is that they are having trouble in remembering the names of people. This can hit us in our fifties. The problem cannot simply be that the names of people are arbitrary because so is the name of a cow; each language has a different word for this.

Our knowledge of the meanings of words forms part of our semantic knowledge and this degenerates in people who suffer from ‘semantic dementia’ in old age. The syndrome results from the loss of the temporal and prefrontal tissue shown in Figure 13; and critically this includes the perirhinal cortex. Damage to the perirhinal cortex has been shown to lead to problems in naming things, but this problem is worse the more they are perceptually and semantically confusable.

Now consider the names of people. Different people share many visual features: they have eyes, noses, and so on. But there are also many other properties that the people that we know have in common: they may be colleagues or they may be in our list of email contacts. So all these people are confusable and yet the name that we are trying to remember is only attached to one of them. The result is that remembering personal names is one of the most taxing semantic tasks and thus one that is particularly sensitive to ageing.
