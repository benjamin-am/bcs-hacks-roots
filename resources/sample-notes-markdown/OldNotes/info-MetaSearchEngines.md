## Metasearch Engines

However, they differ from the “real” search engines in that they do not have their own index but, as soon as the user enters a query, they retrieve results from several other, “real” search engines, merge them, and display them in their own results display
The idea behind metasearch engines is that no one search engine can cover the entire Web. Therefore, combining the results of several search engines that cover different areas of the Web would be worthwhile. 
A second advantage is supposed to lie in a better relevance ranking of the results since the best results are already fetched by each of the giving search engines, from which a ranking of the best is then created.
A criticism: the advantages are claimed but not empirically proven
Metasearch is also outdated, as today’s SEs no longer have coverage problems
Even other advantage of ranking is dead today, as universal SEs have better ranking algorithms
