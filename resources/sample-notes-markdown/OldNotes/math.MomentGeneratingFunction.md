## Moment Generating Functions

Up to now we have described distributions of random variables with probability
mass functions, probability density functions, and cumulative distribution func-
tions. The moment generating function (m.g.f.) offers an alternative way to char-
acterize the distribution. Furthermore, as the name suggests, it can also be used
to compute moments of a random variable.
Definition 5.1. The moment generating function of a random variable X is
defined by M(t) = E(e^(tX)). It is a function of the real variable t.
The moment generating function is analogous to Fourier and Laplace trans-
forms commonly used in engineering and applied mathematics. As with other
notation, we write MX(t) if we wish to distinguish the random variable X. We
begin with two examples, first a discrete and then a continuous random variable.
Example 5.2. Let X be a discrete random variable with probability mass function
P (X = âˆ’1) = 1/3 , P (X = 4) = 1/6 , and P (X = 9) = 1/2 .
Find the moment generating function of X.
