## Looking and Attending

In the laboratory it is the experimenter who specifies the task. Michael Posner came up with a classic paradigm in which the observers are instructed to look out for the appearance of a visual target in the periphery of their vision. However, they are also to keep their eyes fixed on a central dot. So their attention is said to be ‘covert’; in other words there should be no overt eye movements. On 80 per cent of trials the target appears on the side to which the people are attending, but on 20 per cent of trials it appears on the unattended side. This arrangement means that it is possible to demonstrate the benefit of attending: the targets on the attended side are detected more quickly than the targets on the unattended side.

If people are scanned while they are covertly attending to one side, the effect is an enhancement in the activation; this means the activation is greater when attending than when not doing so. The enhancement is found in two regions. One is the cortex that lies in the intraparietal sulcus, a deep fissure in the parietal cortex (Figure 7). The other is the area of the prefrontal cortex referred to as the frontal eye field (Figure 7).
