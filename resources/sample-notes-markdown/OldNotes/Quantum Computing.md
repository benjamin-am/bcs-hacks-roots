# Quantum Computing

Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanical phenomena to perform computations fundamentally different from classical computers. While classical bits exist in states of 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in superpositions of both states simultaneously. Entanglement allows qubits to be correlated in ways impossible for classical bits, enabling unique computational approaches. Quantum algorithms like Shor's for factoring large numbers and Grover's for database searching offer exponential and quadratic speedups respectively for specific problems. Quantum supremacy—demonstrating capabilities beyond any classical computer—represents a major milestone. Physical implementations include superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and topological qubits. Decoherence—unwanted interaction with the environment causing loss of quantum properties—presents a major engineering challenge. Quantum error correction techniques aim to maintain reliable computation despite physical noise. While universal quantum computers remain in early development, quantum annealing and quantum simulators already address specialized optimization and material science problems.
