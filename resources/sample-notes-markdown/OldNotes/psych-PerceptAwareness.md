## Perceptual Awareness

It is this organization that explains why, if magnetic pulses are applied to the earliest stages of visual processing, people report that they only see elementary flashes of light. But how can we explain the fact that they are aware of these flashes?

This issue was long thought to be a topic for philosophy rather than science. Then Larry Weiskrantz made an astonishing discovery. He was studying two patients who had damage to their primary visual cortex in one hemisphere. As expected, they were blind in one half of their visual field, meaning that they were unable to see anything that was presented on the side of space that was opposite to their lesion.

But surprisingly they could still guess accurately the orientation of a line or the direction in which it was moving. And this was true even though they were not aware of seeing the line. The explanation for this ‘blindsight’, as he called it, is that visual information can still reach the cortex through routes that bypass the primary visual cortex.

This demonstrates that the primary visual cortex is necessary for visual awareness, but it does not tell us whether it is sufficient. To find out we can scan people when they are or are not visually aware and see what, if any, other areas are activated.
