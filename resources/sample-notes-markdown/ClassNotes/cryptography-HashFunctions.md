## Hash Functions

Cryptography depends on hash functions, key generation, and secure transformations to protect data. Hash functions take an input and produce a fixed-size output (hash), which ensures data integrity by making it computationally difficult to reverse or find collisions. Popular hash functions like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are used in applications such as digital signatures and password hashing. Key generation creates encryption and decryption keys, with symmetric encryption using the same key for both processes and asymmetric encryption using a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Algorithms like AES and RSA are commonly employed for generating and using these keys, ensuring secure data exchange between parties.

The transformation of data through encryption and digital signatures is central to cryptographic security. In encryption, plaintext is converted to ciphertext using keys, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt it. Digital signatures work by hashing a message and signing it with a private key to verify authenticity. These techniques are vital for secure communication, blockchain technology, and authentication systems, ensuring that data remains confidential, untampered, and verifiable by authorized users. Cryptographic methods like these safeguard the integrity and authenticity of digital information in modern systems.
