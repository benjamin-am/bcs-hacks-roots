## Asymmetry and Chirality

Chirality in organic chemistry refers to molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images, known as enantiomers, due to the presence of an asymmetric (chiral) center, usually a carbon bonded to four different groups. This asymmetry leads to optical activity, where enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions (dextrorotatory vs. levorotatory). Chirality is crucial in biological systems and pharmaceuticals, as enantiomers can have vastly different effects in biological reactions. Diastereomers, which are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, also arise in molecules with multiple chiral centers. Methods like Fischer projections, R/S notation, and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules help determine absolute configurations of chiral molecules.
