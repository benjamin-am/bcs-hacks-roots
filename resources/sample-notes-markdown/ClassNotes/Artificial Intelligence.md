# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence systems attempt to mimic or replicate aspects of human cognition. Modern AI approaches include symbolic reasoning, neural networks, and probabilistic methods. Large language models like GPT demonstrate emergent capabilities when scaled to sufficient size. The Chinese Room thought experiment questions whether syntactic manipulation of symbols can produce genuine understanding. AI researchers distinguish between narrow AI (specialized for specific tasks) and general AI (with human-like flexibility across domains). Recent advances in multimodal learning allow systems to process different types of information—text, images, audio—simultaneously. The field confronts technical challenges like catastrophic forgetting and alignment with human values. While current systems excel at pattern recognition, common-sense reasoning and causal understanding remain difficult. The goal of artificial general intelligence raises profound questions about machine consciousness and rights.
