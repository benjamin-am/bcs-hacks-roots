This chapter describes technical basis of search engines
How documents on the web are brought into search engines and how they are made searchable
Link between search query and documents in the database is established
Search engine definition:
A search engine (web search engine; universal search engine) is a computer system that captures distributed content from the World Wide Web via crawling and makes it searchable through a UI, listing the results in a presentation ordered according to relevance assumed by the system
Computer system
System indicates that it is more than one computer - it’s a multitude of computers linked together to perform different functions which jointly form the search engine
Distributed content from the WWW:
There is a restriction to specific content. WWW is part of the internet, and search engines are limited to this part. If we expected search engines to search the entire internet - that’d include emails and other internet content
This content is inherently distributed, no central repository where it is stored
Links between documents form the network. These links are used by users and search engines
Crawling:
We only refer to search engines when the systems in question capture contents of the Web by following links - this link following is called crawling
Links from known documents are followed, then new documents are discovered and this makes a network
With this network, we have an image of the WWW then we can search this image
You can also add content to the search engine by other methods, crawling isn’t the only way
User interface:
A UI is required in which the user can enter search queries and view results
Relevance as assumed by the system
Results are ordered according to relevance
It is more accurate to use the phrase “according to relevance as assumed by the system” since there can be no single correct order of search results
Diff docs are relevant for diff users
It is often wrongly assumed that there are right and wrong ways of ordering search results
Presentation ordered according to relevance
Presentation of results by a search engine is not necessarily a simple list, but that complex forms of result presentation are possible. We will discuss the presentation of results in search engines in detail in chap 7
What are the advantages and disadvantages of this definition that we use in this book? First of all, it is relatively open, which means that we will probably be able to classify future systems (whatever they may look like then) as search engines according to this definition. However, one limitation of the definition is that it explicitly refers to the World Wide Web and crawling. More precisely, we would have to speak of Web search engines instead of search engines, but this does not correspond to the general usage, which simply refers to search engines
