## Content Acquisition for Search Engines
Three areas of content acquisition
Scan and link
External content is collected, aggregated, and made available for search
This is basis for search engines, most important form of content acquisition
Two most important forms in this area:
Crawling 
Content delivery via feeds
Host and serve:
Content created by users is collected and hosted on a search engine providerâ€™s platform
Data is stored under the control of a search engine provider
Content comes from users
Youtube and Google maps host data, and can be integrated into regular Google searches
Scan and serve
Items from real world are transferred to digital world by the search engine provider 
Google has scanned a large number of books from libraries and makes them available in its search engine
Search engine providers also build up their own databases, which are included in the search engine but not created by the users
Two main ways to capture external content available on the web are feeds and crawling
Feeds are used to transmit structured info to the search engine
Product search engines (vertical search engine): retailers make their product catalogs available to search engines in the form of XML files
Detailed info about a product can be determined precisely
Disadvantage - search engines are dependent on info providers making the data available to them in the appropriate form
Crawling
Capturing content on web by following links
Crawiling is the MOST important method for search engines to discover content
It is an excellent way to find content without the content producers actively participating in the process. In addition, it is the only method that can effectively cover a large part of the World Wide Web.
