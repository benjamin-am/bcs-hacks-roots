## Vertical Search Engines

Vertical search engines aim to capture as many documents as possible from selected websites. The term “vertical search engines” is often used instead of “special search engines”; in this terminology, universal search engines are referred to as horizontal search engines.
Restricted to specific topic, make targeted search possible
Ranking can be adapted to documents they index
The fact that vertical search engines cannot be replaced by universal search engines results from the problems of the latter:
Universal search engines have technical restrictions and (despite the label universal) cannot cover the entire Web. 
There are financial hurdles that restrict the collection of content and its indexing. 
Universal search engines are geared toward the average user. 
They have to provide consistent indexing of all content so that everything is searchable together.
Hybrid search engines are a particular type of vertical. They cover a selected part of the WWW but add additional content from databases to the resulting inventory. This database content is not part of the WWW and, therefore, cannot be found through standard search engines
