## Theory of Mind

Theory of Mind is the cognitive ability to attribute mental states—such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions—to oneself and others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and perspectives that are different from one’s own. This theory plays a crucial role in social interaction and communication, allowing individuals to predict and interpret the behaviors of others. It is often seen as a key developmental milestone in children, typically emerging around age 4 or 5. ToM also has implications in understanding empathy, social cognition, and various psychological disorders, such as autism, where deficits in ToM are often observed. Cognitive scientists study how this ability develops and how it varies across different species, using techniques like perspective-taking tasks to measure individuals' understanding of others' mental states.
