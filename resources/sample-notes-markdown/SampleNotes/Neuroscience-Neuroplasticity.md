# Neuroplasticity

Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Contrary to earlier beliefs that brain structure was fixed after childhood, research shows that neural pathways continuously adapt in response to experience, learning, and injury. Hebbian learning, summarized as "neurons that fire together, wire together," explains how synaptic connections strengthen with repeated activation. Different forms include structural plasticity (physical changes in brain architecture) and functional plasticity (ability to move functions from damaged areas to undamaged ones). Critical periods represent windows of heightened plasticity for specific abilities like language acquisition. Environmental enrichment enhances brain development, while stress and trauma can negatively impact plasticity mechanisms. Understanding neuroplasticity has revolutionized rehabilitation approaches for stroke recovery, treatment for learning disorders, and general approaches to education throughout the lifespan.
