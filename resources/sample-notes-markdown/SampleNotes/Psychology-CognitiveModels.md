Cognitive models like the *Atkinson-Shiffrin Model* and *Baddeley’s Working Memory Model* offer frameworks for understanding how information is processed and stored in the brain. The Atkinson-Shiffrin Model, also known as the multi-store model, posits that memory is divided into three distinct stores: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Information passes from sensory memory to short-term memory through attention and can be transferred to long-term memory through rehearsal. In contrast, Baddeley’s Working Memory Model expands on the short-term memory concept, proposing that working memory is a dynamic system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information. It includes the central executive that controls attention and coordinates information from two subsystems: the phonological loop (handling verbal and auditory information) and the visuospatial sketchpad (handling visual and spatial information). Baddeley later added the episodic buffer, which integrates information across modalities and connects working memory to long-term memory. Both models provide important insights into how we process and retain information in our daily lives.
