In this videoÂ we talk about Abstraction. Some types of abstraction you've likely seen before, and some might be new to you. This will set us up for this module's main topic: Data Abstraction.

# What is it?
- we want to hide the details of something behind an interface or container

# We know statements!
statements are provided by a programming language 
- don't have to go through machine instructions lol
x = 1
- want 1 to be assigned to memory location labeled x
- our abstraction is the equals operator

The implementation
- will do all the assignment work

- the assignment work could be a ton of low-level code
- but we only care about the x = 1

# Functional abstraction
- how programming languages allow you to define your own abstractions
- make a function called sort(x)
	- it can be whatever you want

# Data abstraction
- in Java we use classes to do data abstractions

- Drawing player
	- Shape 
	- Drawing
	- MidiSynth
- inside of each of these they have methods, fields, and implementations
