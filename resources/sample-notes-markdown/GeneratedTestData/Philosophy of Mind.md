# Philosophy of Mind

The philosophy of mind investigates the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical world. The hard problem of consciousness asks why subjective experience exists at all. Dualists like Descartes argue that mind and body are fundamentally different substances, while physicalists maintain that mental states are ultimately physical states. Functionalism defines mental states by their causal roles rather than their composition. The concept of qualia refers to the subjective, qualitative aspects of experience—what it's like to see red or feel pain. Philosophical zombies, hypothetical beings physically identical to humans but lacking consciousness, challenge physicalist accounts. Intentionality—the "aboutness" of mental states—poses difficult questions about how physical processes can represent or refer to things in the world.
