# Reward Mechanisms and Addiction Psychology

The brain's reward system, centered around dopamine pathways, evolved to reinforce survival behaviors but can be hijacked in addiction. When activated by natural rewards like food or social connection, the mesolimbic pathway releases dopamine, creating feelings of pleasure and motivation. In addiction, substances or behaviors trigger supraphysiological dopamine release, which eventually leads to downregulation of receptors and tolerance. Conditioning plays a crucial role as environmental cues become associated with rewards through repeated pairings. These cues trigger dopamine release even before reward delivery, creating powerful cravings in addiction contexts. The transition from voluntary to compulsive use involves shifts from prefrontal cortex control to habitual processing in the striatum. Stress systems involving corticotropin-releasing factor and norepinephrine interact with reward circuits, explaining why stress often triggers relapse. Individual vulnerability factors include genetic predispositions affecting dopamine receptor density, early life experiences that shape stress responses, and co-occurring mental health conditions. Understanding these neurobiological mechanisms has led to targeted interventions like cue exposure therapy and medications that modulate dopamine transmission.
