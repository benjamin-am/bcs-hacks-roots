# Machine Learning

Machine learning systems learn patterns from data without explicit programming. Supervised learning algorithms train on labeled examples to make predictions, while unsupervised learning discovers patterns without guidance. Reinforcement learning uses reward signals to develop optimal strategies. A critical challenge is generalizationâ€”ensuring models perform well on unseen data without overfitting to training examples. Models must balance bias and variance: overly simple models miss important patterns, while complex ones may capture noise. Cross-validation and other statistical techniques help validate model reliability. Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers to learn hierarchical representations. Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and handling unbalanced datasets remain important practical concerns. The field increasingly addresses explainability and fairness in algorithmic decision-making.
