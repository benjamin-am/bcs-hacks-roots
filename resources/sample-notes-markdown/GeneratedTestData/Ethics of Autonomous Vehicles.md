# Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles

Self-driving car technology raises profound ethical dilemmas about algorithmic decision-making in life-or-death situations. The trolley problem—whether to divert harm from many to few—takes on practical significance when programming collision responses. Utilitarian approaches would minimize overall harm, while deontological perspectives might prohibit actively causing any deaths. Questions arise about who bears responsibility for algorithmic decisions: manufacturers, software developers, regulators, or vehicle owners. Different cultural and legal frameworks worldwide complicate standardizing ethical guidelines across markets. Privacy concerns emerge regarding location tracking and surveillance capabilities of connected vehicles. The transition period with mixed autonomous and human drivers presents unique challenges. Equitable access to transportation might improve with autonomous vehicles, but job displacement for professional drivers creates social concerns. These ethical considerations require collaboration between engineers, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to develop acceptable frameworks.
