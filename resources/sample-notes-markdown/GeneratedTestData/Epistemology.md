# Epistemology

Epistemology explores how we acquire knowledge and what constitutes justified belief. Philosophers distinguish between a priori knowledge (known independent of experience) and a posteriori knowledge (derived from experience). The problem of induction questions whether we can reliably generalize from specific observations to universal principles. Different frameworks like coherentism argue that beliefs are justified when they form a coherent system, while foundationalism suggests some basic beliefs require no further justification. Gettier problems challenge the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief by presenting scenarios where someone has a justified true belief that nonetheless doesn't seem to qualify as knowledge. The reliability of different sources of knowledge—perception, reason, testimony, memory—remains a central concern in this field.
