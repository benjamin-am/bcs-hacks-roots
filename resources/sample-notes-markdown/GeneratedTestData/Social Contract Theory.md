# Social Contract Theory

Social contract theory explains political authority and legitimacy through the concept of an agreement among citizens. Hobbes argued that in the state of nature—without government—life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short," motivating people to form societies for protection. Locke emphasized that government derives its authority from the consent of the governed and must protect natural rights. Rousseau famously claimed that "man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains," suggesting modern society corrupts natural human goodness. These theories address how individual freedom relates to collective governance. The concept of tacit consent explores how people implicitly agree to social contracts by accepting their benefits. Contemporary theorists extend these ideas to questions of global justice, intergenerational obligations, and the legitimacy of international institutions in an increasingly interconnected world.
