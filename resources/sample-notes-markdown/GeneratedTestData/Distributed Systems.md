Distributed Systems

Distributed systems consist of multiple computers working together to appear as a single coherent system. These systems must address fundamental challenges like concurrency, partial failures, and network unreliability. The CAP theorem states that distributed systems cannot simultaneously guarantee consistency, availability, and partition toleranceâ€”trade-offs must be made. Consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft allow distributed nodes to agree on shared state despite failures. Byzantine fault tolerance addresses scenarios where nodes may act maliciously or provide incorrect information. Distributed architectures include client-server, peer-to-peer, and microservices. Techniques like sharding partition data across nodes, while replication maintains copies for redundancy and availability. Modern cloud computing, blockchain systems, and internet infrastructure all rely on distributed systems principles to achieve scale, reliability, and performance.
