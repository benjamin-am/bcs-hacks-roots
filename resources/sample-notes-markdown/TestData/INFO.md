# Attention Economy and Social Media Design

In the attention economy, human attention is treated as a scarce commodity and the primary currency of online business models. Social media platforms employ sophisticated psychological techniques to maximize user engagement. Variable reward schedules—similar to slot machines—create dopamine-driven feedback loops when users refresh feeds or check notifications. Infinite scrolling removes natural stopping cues, while algorithmic content curation constantly optimizes for maximum engagement by tracking behavioral patterns. Features like streaks, likes, and follower counts leverage social validation and FOMO (fear of missing out) to drive compulsive checking. The color red in notification badges triggers alert responses, while deliberate loading delays create anticipation that reinforces checking behavior. Dark patterns in interface design make disengagement difficult through hidden settings or multiple confirmation steps. Many product designers formerly employed at major platforms have become whistleblowers, revealing how engagement metrics prioritize time-on-device over user wellbeing
