# Software Design Patterns

Software design patterns provide reusable solutions to common problems in software architecture. Creational patterns like Factory and Singleton manage object creation mechanisms. Structural patterns including Adapter and Composite define relationships between entities. Behavioral patterns such as Observer and Strategy organize communication between objects. These patterns enhance code maintainability, readability, and flexibility while reducing technical debt. Refactoring—restructuring code without changing external behavior—often involves implementing established patterns. Antipatterns document common mistakes like "spaghetti code" or "god objects" that violate software engineering principles. Modern development practices combine multiple patterns to create architectures suited to specific domains. While patterns provide valuable templates, their appropriate application requires understanding their trade-offs and contextual suitability. Clean architecture approaches emphasize separation of concerns and dependency management to create systems that remain adaptable as requirements evolve.
