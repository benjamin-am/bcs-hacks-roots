Before we move on to considering the use cases of a Data Abstraction, watch this video to see what the specification of our IntegerSet looks like in IntelliJ. You can download the complete specification from the video [here](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC210/DataAbstractionLectureStarters) from GitHub. Follow along in the **IntegerSetStarter** project in the repository. 

**Technical points in this video:**

- We start thinking about usage scenarios by putting stubs in for all the methods in the class. These stubs include the proper signature (name, parameter list) and full specifications.
- The body of the stubs contains only enough code to get the method to compile.  If there is no return type (void), then the method body is left empty.  If there is a return type, then a single line returning a dummy value is put inside the method's code block.
